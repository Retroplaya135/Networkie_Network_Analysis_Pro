### Networkie - An Advanced Network Analysis Python Script

A versatile and powerful Python-based network analysis tool for performing ICMP/UDP/TCP checks, OS detection, SNMP queries, traceroutes, and SSH connectivity tests. 

**Supports logging, scheduling, and concurrency for efficient network management.**

## Key Features

1. **ICMP, TCP, and UDP Checks**:
   - Test the reachability of hosts using ICMP.
   - Scan for open TCP and UDP ports.

2. **OS Detection**:
   - Guess the operating system of a target using TCP SYN fingerprinting (requires Scapy).

3. **SNMP Queries**:
   - Fetch SNMP data for additional insights (requires `pysnmp`).

4. **Traceroute**:
   - Trace the route packets take to a target host.

5. **SSH Connectivity Test**:
   - Test SSH access using provided credentials (requires `paramiko`).

6. **Logging**:
   - Detailed logging of operations for debugging and analysis.

7. **Scheduling**:
   - Automate scans at regular intervals.

8. **Concurrency**:
   - Perform tasks efficiently with multithreading.

9. **Report Generation**:
   - Export results in JSON, CSV, or PDF format.
   - Create visual reports using matplotlib and networkx.
